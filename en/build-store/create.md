# Create a brand store

To create a brand store, you need to contact your Canonical sales representative, that will transmit your store creation request to the engineering teams.

A few things to know when asking for a store:

* A brand store can be empty or inherit some or all snaps from another store. This is a choice you need to make at creation time.
* Stores can be open for all uploaders or restricted to a selected list
* Stores can enforce manual reviews for each upload or rely on the automated review process (and apply further security policies as needed)

[Get in touch with Canonical &rsaquo;](https://www.ubuntu.com/internet-of-things/contact-us)

## Prerequisites

For this request to go through, your sales representative will ask you:

* The store visible name
* Is the store unlisted and only reachable by developers and end users who know it's id?
* Does the store will force manual review on every snap revision?
* Does the store allow for paid snaps?
* Does the store inherits snaps from any other stores?
* Is the store open for uploads? If no, you will have to specify a list of existing store users (by email) to be granted upload rights
* A list of existing store users (specified by their email address) to be defined as store reviewers
* A list of existing store users (by email) to be granted store admin rights
* A list of existing store users (specified by their email address) to be defined as store admins

### Important

Please note that for adding admins, reviewers and (optionally)
uploaders you need to ensure that these users have logged in to
[the store](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/) at least once.

## Accessing your store

To access your store, you need to:

* log in to the [main snap store](https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com)
* click on the arrow next to your name at the top right of the screen
* click on the **Stores you can access** menu item
* click on your store name in the list, it should be under the **You can manage and change settings in the stores** header

This will take your to your [store settings](settings.md).
