# Get started with a brand store

A brand store is a way to provide your branded Ubuntu Core devices, and Linux machines in general, with a selected set of applications packaged as snaps to install. Brand stores can inherit from other snap stores and be opened to all uploaders, or only contain snaps of your choice and have a selected list of uploaders.

This documentation will walk you through:

* Setting up your brand store for reviewers and developers to use
* Changing its settings and tuning security policies for automated reviews
* Enabling developers to push and release snaps to it
* Reporting issues and getting in touch for support

First, let's have a look at how to request the creation of a brand store.
