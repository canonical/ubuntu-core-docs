# Build a kernel snap

The kernel snap one of the essential snaps that need to be specified in the [model assertion](/reference/assertions/model) when building a [custom image](/how-to-guides/image-creation/add-custom-snaps). The snap can be updated but it cannot be swapped for a different kernel snap.

Canonical publishes several reference kernel snaps, alongside kernel snaps for certified public clouds and general purpose computing images for popular physical devices, such as 64-bit x86, Raspberry Pi and RISC-V.

A custom Linux kernel build allows for device-specific architectures, configuration and modifications, and manually building the kernel snap has the same advantages and requirements. 

Before building a kernel snap, we highly recommend building a working kernel first before migrating this to a kernel snap. The same configuration options and dependencies will be required.

See [Kernel snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs/the-kernel-snap) for reference details on what gadget snaps can contain, and see [Types of snap](/explanation/core-elements/snaps-in-ubuntu-core.md#types-of-snap) for details on the other types of snap that make up an Ubuntu Core image. 

```{important}
Building a kernel snap is useful for prototyping but its maintenance and support becomes your responsibility.
```

## Inside a kernel snap

A kernel snap contain the Linux kernel image and its associated modules, alongside a _RAM disk image_ for system initialisation and optional firmware and device tree files.

Its size and complexity corresponds to the size and complexity of the un-snapped kernel. The `pc-kernel` snap for Linux 6.8.0-40, for example, contains over 1400 directories and 9000 files, with the majority of those files providing firmware and kernel module drivers.

```
├── config-6.8.0-40-generic
├── doc
├── firmware
├── kernel.efi
├── meta
├── modules
├── snap
└── System.map-6.8.0-40-generic
```

The `snap` directory includes the [snapcraft.yaml](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-schema) that was used to build the kernel snap.

Canonical’s IoT Devices Field team maintains a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/canonical/iot-field-kernel-snap/tree/main) that includes template files in its main branch, and example kernel implementations for the following architectures in its branches:

* [22-amd64-pc](https://github.com/canonical/iot-field-kernel-snap/tree/22-amd64-pc)
* [24-risc64-nezha](https://github.com/canonical/iot-field-kernel-snap/tree/24-riscv64-nezha)
* [24-riscv64-visionfive2](https://github.com/canonical/iot-field-kernel-snap/tree/24-riscv64-visionfive2)
* [22-orange-pi-5plus](https://github.com/canonical/iot-field-kernel-snap/tree/22-arm64-orange-pi-5plus)

### Template: snapcraft.yaml

# A kernel snap breaks down into four major components:
#   1) The kernel image itself (vmlinuz, bzImage, Image, etc.)
#   2) The kernel modules (*.ko)
#   3) The kernel firmware blobs (provided by linux-firmware)
#   4) the initrd (a CPIO archive)
# The final kernel payload can be booted in a couple different ways, depending
# on the capabilities of the target platform:
#   a) as an EFI binary
#      On sufficiently recent platforms (e.g. x86_64 since 2015), the kernel
#      can be booted as an EFI binary application directly by the motherboard
#      firmware. This capability requires EFISTUB support in the kernel. See the
#      EFISTUB documentation: https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/efi-stub.html
#   b) by GRUB or some other bootloader
#      This is the more traditional method for booting kernels, which involves
#      some intermediary binary program like GRUB or u-boot to load the kernel
#      into memory and then execute it.
# On Ubuntu Core, (b) is the expected approach. The bootloader is shipped by
# the gadget and controls the bootflow process of the target hardware, whereas
# option (a) would be more often seen on normal consumer devices rather than the
# IoT edge appliances Ubuntu Core usually targets.

# Once the kernel has done it's initialization steps, it then executes bin/init
# from either the initrd or the root filesystem on disk. Generally speaking,
# an initrd can be forgone if all required kernel modules for booting the
# target platform are builtin to the kernel directly instead of being built
# as separate modules. HOWEVER, In the particular case of Ubuntu Core, the
# initrd provides several key components for bootstrapping an Ubuntu Core
# system. As a result, even if ALL kernel modules are builtin to the kernel
# directly, an initrd will STILL be required.

# Thus, a typical bootflow is:
# bootloader (gadget) -> kernel (kernel snap) -> initrd (kernel snap) -> userspace (base snap)

# Please provide descriptive comments as necessary. Not everything needs to
# be documented or explained, but explaining why things are done can always help
# people who are learning!

  # The kernel itself can either be repackaged from some upstream or built from

  # There are a couple reasons to want to build a kernel from source:
  #   * changing what features are built as modules versus builtin

  #   * patching a kernel to support a whole platform

  # It's possible that Canonical does not maintain a kernel which supports the
  # target hardware (this is true of most ARM or RISC-V hardware, for instance).
  # In such a case, the board's upstream kernel should be used (frequently these
  # sources can be found in that manufacturer's BSP), or (if that manufacturer

  # recent version of the upstream kernel available from https://github.com/torvalds/linux.
  # In either case, additional patches will almost certainly be required in

  # to support snaps in the upstream kernel, but earlier kernel versions will
  # still require some amount of patching. A sample of a collection of minimum

# modules on Ubuntu Core systems, but it come down to one of two interfaces:
# kernel-module-load: https://snapcraft.io/docs/kernel-module-load-interface
#   kernel-module-load allows specifying modules by name to either load on-boot
#   or dynamically (via snapctl kmod) with optional arguments, and a list of
#   modules to deny loading.
# kernel-module-control: https://snapcraft.io/docs/kernel-module-control-interface
#   kernel-module-control gives broad sweeping control over any and all kernel
#   modules which can be loaded or unloaded.
# kernel-module-load should always be preferred as it is a more targeted interface.
# In order for this interface to autoconnect, a support ticket must be filed or
# a forum post made.

## Build the snap

The build system must support [snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd), and have both the [Snapcraft](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/how-to/setup/set-up-snapcraft/) build tool and the [LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd) virtualisation platform installed, all of which are provided by any Ubuntu release.

Unlike broader snap packages, kernel snaps are typically built within the host environment using [snapcraft --destructive-mode](https://snapcraft.io/docs/build-options). This step can still be isolated from the host system by building the kernel with [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/), which also allows you to modify the LXD environment and to more easily rebuild the kernel snap. To do this, install LXD (if it's not already installed), instantiate an Ubuntu image and create the kernel build there:

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
sudo lxd init --auto
sudo lxc launch ubuntu:22.04 jammy
sudo lxc shell jammy
snap install snapcraft --classic
```

With _snapcraft.yaml_ complete, and the kernel source either cloned locally or linked to from the snapcraft.yaml, the `snapcraft` command will build the kernel. As mentioned earlier, it's often more convenient to build the kernel within the host environment, using `--destructive-mode`:

```bash
# snapcraft --destructive-mode --build-for=arm64
[...]
Snapped kernal-snap-name_arm64.snap
```

If the above command was executed within an LXD environment, the resultant kernel snap can be extracted with the following commands:

```bash
# exit
$ lxc file pull path/to/kernal-snap-name_arm64.snap .
```

The kernel snap has now been built and is ready to be integrated into an Ubuntu Core image. See [Custom images](/how-to-guides/image-creation/add-custom-snaps) for further details.
