# Ubuntu Core support duration

The support period for Ubuntu Core follows the [Long Term Support](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) (LTS) model adopted by all major releases of Ubuntu.

An optional _Legacy Support_ can be added to expand security maintenance (ESM) for an additional 2 years, resulting in 12 years of coverage overall for newer releases. See [Expanded Security Maintenance
for Ubuntu and open source](https://ubuntu.com/security/esm) for further details.
