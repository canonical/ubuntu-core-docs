# Ubuntu Core support duration

Ubuntu Core follows our [Long Term Support](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) (LTS) model. Each release includes 10 years of security maintenance. 

A Legacy add-on can be optionally purchased to cover an additional 5 years of security maintenance, resulting in 15 years of coverage overall. The Legacy add-on is available through an [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) subscription.
