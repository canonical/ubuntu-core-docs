# Ubuntu Core support duration


Ubuntu Core receives 10 years of support by default, following the [Long Term Support](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) (LTS) model adopted by all major releases of Ubuntu.

An optional _Legacy Support_ duration can be added to provide an additional 2 years of support, resulting in 12 years of coverage overall for newer releases.
