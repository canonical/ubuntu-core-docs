# System snaps

System snaps provide additional device functionality, usually associated with connectivity. They're managed and maintained by separate projects outside of the central Ubuntu Core.

## Connectivity options

There are several system snaps that can be used to connect to a local or wide area network, as well as local devices over Bluetooth.

- [Bluetooth manager](bluetooth/index)
- [Modem Manager](modem-manager/index)
- [Network Manager](network-manager/index)
- [Udisks2](udisks2/index)
