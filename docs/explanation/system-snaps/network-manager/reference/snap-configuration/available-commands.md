The NetworkManager upstream project comes with a few commands which can be used to control and manage the NetworkManager service. This page gives a short overview of those commands which are available as part of the snap and what they are used for. Further details about their usage is given on linked pages.

## nmcli

The nmcli command offers a command-line based way to control and manage the NetworkManager service.

An explanatory description of the command and available options are available [here](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/1.2/nmcli.html)

## network-manager.nmtui

nmtui is the Network Manager Text User Interface. It is a curses-based application that allows easy configuration of connections and networking settings. Besides network-manager.nmtui, these other three commands are available:

* network-manager.nmtui-edit
* network-manager.nmtui-connect
* network-manager.nmtui-hostname
