# The redirects.txt file stores all the redirects for the published docs
# If you change a filename, move or delete a file, you need a redirect here.
# - Comment lines start with a hash (#) and are ignored
# - Each redirect should appear on its own line

# We are using the dirhtml builder, so files are treated as directories:
# - A file is built like `filename/index.html`, not `filename.html`
# - *Do* include a trailing slash at the end of the path
# - *Do not* include a file extension or you'll get errors
# - Paths don't need a slash in front of them

# Example:
# redirect/from/file/ redirect/to/file/
