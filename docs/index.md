# Ubuntu Core documentation

**Ubuntu Core is Ubuntu engineered for embedded and IoT systems.** Every element runs within a confined sandbox.

**It provides a deployment infrastructure for developers to deploy production images**, creating a minimal, secure, and transaction-based operating environment for your applications.

**Ubuntu Core reduces the time needed to flash and provision images in production lines**, ensuring they're secure while delivering the desired user-experience to your users.

**From Linux and maker space tinkerers, to the robotics, automotive and signage industries;** from a single device, to a deployment of thousands: Ubuntu Core can handle it.
